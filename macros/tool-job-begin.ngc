( Filename: tool-job-begin.ngc )
( LinuxCNC Manual Tool-Change Subroutines for Milling Machines version 1.1: subroutine 2/2 )
(  )

( In the LinuxCNC .ini config file, under the [RS274NGC] section add: )
(    REMAP=M600  modalgroup=6 ngc=tool-job-begin )
(  )

( Usage: M600 is used at the beginning of the first g-code file of a job so that the next M6 will measure the tool for reference )
(             instead of caluculating a tool length offset. It can also be invoked manually through the MDI before a job starts. )

	      #<_ToolZRef> = 0             ( Following were added to clear the memory as residual parameters )
	      #<_ToolZ> = 0                ( created incorrect settings )
